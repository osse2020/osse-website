# Our Mission

Searching for Scientific Order in the Complexity of Open Sourcing Worlds

Our researchers endeavor to understand and unify the underlying, shared patterns in open source worlds. Our global research network of scholars spans borders, departments, and disciplines, unifying curious minds steeped in rigorous logical, mathematical, and computational reasoning. As we reveal the unseen mechanisms and processes that shape these open and evolving worlds, we seek to use this understanding to promote the well-being of humankind and of life on earth.

# OSSE Institute's History

Founded in 2020, the Open Source Social Engineering Institute was the first research institute dedicated to the study of open source ecosystems. We are operated as an independent, nonprofit research and education center.
